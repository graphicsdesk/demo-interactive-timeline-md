              <br><br>
              New students will have to attend the New Student Orientation Program—more commonly known as NSOP. For first-years in Columbia College and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, NSOP will start on Sunday, Aug. 25, while Barnard first-years start their orientation on Wednesday, Aug. 28. The program’s specific contents will vary depending on your school and the group you’re in, but this week will generally include getting to know campus, adjusting to programs at your school, talking to older students, and maybe even getting to know New York City.

              <br><br>

            
              The first day of classes will follow Labor Day, which falls on Sept. 2—officially starting not only the fall semester, but also the class registration “shopping period.” While the first day feels momentous—like you’re starting a whole new chapter of your life—your Tuesday class schedule will follow your normal class schedule.

              <br>
              <br>
              For the first two weeks of classes, students can add and drop courses as they please—or at least, as class sizes and credit limits allow. During this time, you are able to over-enroll in credits in the hopes of weeding out that one class you know you won’t stick with or the one that doesn’t live up to its description. You can also attend classes you’re on the waitlist for, in case space opens up by the end of the two weeks. This period of time is perfect if you’re undecided about classes, have an overflowing schedule, or simply want to try out a class for a few weeks. However, remember that even though it is shopping period, many classes will have assignments and work to be done.

             <br>
             <br>

While the shopping period ends after the first two weeks of classes, Columbia College, School of General Studies, and Barnard students have almost an additional month to decide whether or not they definitely want to drop a class. Until this date, you are able to freely drop a class—besides Core Curriculum classes—without it showing up on your transcript, although you may need permission from your advisor to drop the course. SEAS students can drop classes until Nov. 14.

              Columbia has dubbed Oct. 17 as the official midterm date. Unfortunately, you’ll soon find out that midterm exams aren’t just on one day or even in one month. Many classes have multiple midterms, and it can feel like midterm season lasts for months—and sometimes, it does.

              <br>
              <br>
              Sometimes it can feel like Columbia is a school that is all about academics, lacking the school spirit that other colleges have. Homecoming is one occasion where the student body can come together and celebrate the school we go to, attempt to replicate a tailgate, and cheer for our fellow Lions—win or lose. To participate in this honored Columbia tradition, all you need is a trip to Baker Athletics Complex and some Pantone 292 clothes or Columbia merch. Family Days also fall on this weekend and can be an opportunity to show your relatives around campus, meet your friends’ families, and simply reconnect with those you’ve missed.              </p>

              Monday, Nov. 4, is an academic holiday, and Nov. 5 is a holiday for Election Day. These consecutive days give students a four-day weekend, with five days off if you don’t have Friday classes. As the first official days off of the fall semester, students can use this time to visit home, take a well-deserved break, or finally visit those New York City spots they’ve been putting off.               </p>

              If you’re worried about a course you didn’t drop, you have until Nov. 14 to withdraw or elect to pass/D/fail the class. Withdrawing a course means that you won’t finish it; however, it will end up on your transcript as a “W.” Columbia College, General Studies, and Barnard students also have the option to pass/D/fail a course, which means if you get a letter grade of an A, B, or C, the grade will simply show up as a P. If you get a D or an F, the grade will show up on your transcript. SEAS students can pass/fail a course, with grades of D and above showing up as a P. Students across all schools can elect this option for one course each semester, although it cannot be used for certain courses. 
              <br>
              <br>
For SEAS students, Nov. 14 is the last day to drop a course.

              Depending on your class year, your specific registration date will vary. Seniors get access to registration first, on Nov. 18, and the other class years follow.

            <br>
            From Wednesday, Nov. 27, to Friday, Nov. 29, students are given a short, albeit necessary, break from classes for Thanksgiving. With the addition of the weekend, Thanksgiving break comes out to be five days long and may fall at a perfect time—following midterms but before finals season starts and the semester ramps up.

        The final stretch of the semester: final exams. Your finals will typically be spread across this week, but, depending on your classes, you may not have any finals during this period. Typically, the finals schedule drops midway into the semester, although some professors can give projected dates sooner. In the midst of this, students may be preparing to go home for winter break, only to return for the start of the spring semester on Tuesday, Jan. 21.
